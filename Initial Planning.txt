Our "Scrum Master" was a normal member of the team, except with a few added responsibilities.
Firstly and most importantly, our Scrum Master planned meetings, considering the time and location
constraints of individuals as well as time left for the project. For example, most of our team
members had directly conflicting schedules, so our Scrum Master instead insisted that the group
meet once a week electronically via Skype early in the morning for planning meetings.
Our Scrum Master also frequently consulted individual team members outside meetings, taking and sharing
notes about any important status updates (i.e. completion) as status updates were infrequent.
This and the meetings meant that the Scrum Master was a note taker during meetings.
These notes would be used during status meetings and updated as needed. Details were added since
status meetings were more detailed and included progress and not just milestones.

Tasks were sized based entirely on difficulty. A small sized task could be completed in an hour, medium
sized task in less than a day and large tasks spanned more than one day. During our initial planning
meeting, our metrics for an easy task and difficult tasks were based entirely on estimates based
on our abilities, as well as what each task encompassed. Our entire team, including the scrum master
agreed on the size of the task by consensus, and little argument was raised over the size of the task.
