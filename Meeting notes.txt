Meeting log:

19 Oct. 2015
Initial planning meeting. 
Goal: Discuss finer details such as important classes and what IDE to use.
Progress: None code-wise since this is the first meeting. Interpreted artifacts and discussed
how to implement.
Notes:
-Front end = Activities (Title, Connect, Chat) <- Sneh, Taras, Alex
-Back end = Classes (BlueTooth Controller, Device, Connection List) <- Akshay, Priyen, Taras
-Split into "cells" of three, one for front end, one for back end; cells may be reallocated depending
on progress/requirements
To do (expected ETA: end of week):
-Front end: Create activities, make buttons link to other activities, placeholder message sending
-Back end: Create BlueTooth Controller and Device.
-Priority: P2P connection. Then ability to chat P2P. These are the bases of our software.

23 Oct 2015 
Status meeting.
Progress: Activities created with nonfunctional buttons.
Basic interface for BlueTooth Manager (unimplemented connect, send message, manage connections) created.
Significantly less progress than expected or desired.
Notes:
-All group members had particularly busy week, thus not as much time committed as should have been.
-Tasks pushed back to next week (Due 31 Oct 2015)
-Integration of front and back end required; however front and back end need to be made first
-Group member Taras moved to work on back-end as back-end had more work left
To do (by 31 Oct 2015):
-Front end: Create activities, make buttons link to other activities, placeholder message sending
-Back end: Implement BlueTooth Controller and Device

31 Oct 2015
Status meeting:
Progress:
-UI updated to "send" messages to partner by printing to a ListView in ChatActivity.
-TitleScreen button functionality added; these open up new activities
-BlueTooth Manager checks device BlueTooth on/off status, can connect.

Notes:
-Front end and Back end need to be connected
