This is the most downloaded bluetooth chat application on the play store. It is clear from the review of the users that this idea is great, but it has several shortcomings. Our project will try to overcome some of these shortcomings, and add features that we feel could be useful. One major criticism about this app is the inability to send photos of media in chat, a feature present in our project.

There are several other apps on the play store that work on the bluetooth concept. All of them lack the feature of group chat. Our team plans to have a group chat option in addition to individual chats, enabling users to share media and messages to a group. We will also consider the reviews of users for these apps, and try to include the things people like, and do something about the shortcomings.

3. https://code.google.com/p/p2p-communication-framework-for-android/ :
This is a project that allows users to have a personal chat. This is essentially creating a network, where any two users can have personal chat if they are on the network. Our idea enables user to have a group chat instead of the personal chat if they are on the network. Our idea misses the feature of having individual chat with someone on the network; the user can have individual chat only if only if they are directly connected. Our idea is adding the feature of group chat. Also, this project uses flooding to deliver messages; Our idea will use smarter data structures and algorithms, causing less network congestion.

This app is a bluetooth based chat. In this, the user can send message to anyone using bluetooth, and when the message finds a node with internet connection, it sends that message to the server enabling users to send messages when two users are not directly connected through bluetooth. This app lacks group chat. Also, out project is intended to be real time chat, and our main goal is chatting where there is no network.
