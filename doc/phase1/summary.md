Summary:
Objective:
Many of us frequently find ourselves without a network connection throughout
the day, but we still have a need to remain connected during such situations.
Therefore, our objective is to provide people with a communication platform
when they find themselves in areas with no network coverage. In order to
allow communication when no network is available, the service will utilize
Bluetooth to connect the user with people nearby, allowing them to form a
chat group for communication.

Key Uers:
The elderly, who would like a simple way of communicating with nearby caregivers.
Students who want to be able to communicate with friends in class
People who work in remote areas and need updates from co-workers.

Scenarios:
1. Class has just ended and John is in a rush to get to work, but he needs
to remind his project partner Jim to add his changes to the Google
GDocument that they need to submit by 10pm. However, Jim is currently talking
to the professor and John doesn’t want to interrupt them. John wants to text
Jim a reminder, but he has no reception and his phone is about to run out of
battery. John ends up leaving without reminding his partner, instead hoping
that he remembers to add his changes.

2. Jane and Cindy are on the subway heading home after work. They would like
to talk to each about something private that happened at work because it just
can’t wait. However, since they are on a crowded train, they can be overheard
easily, and they have no cellular reception while commuting. They decide to
save the conversation for later, hoping that neither of them forget any
important details.

3. Sam is selling his old phone to someone who replied to his online post, and
plans on meeting the buyer outside a coffee shop downtown. Upon arrival, Sam
notices there are several people outside the coffee shop, and he doesn’t know
which one is the buyer. Sam would like to quickly text the person, but notices
he has no cellular reception. He proceeds to ask everyone nearby if they are the
ones looking to buy his old phone.

4. Shawn works on a construction site away from the city and has no cellular
reception while at work. He is the site manage, and often finds it difficult to
communicate with other people in his team. He needs to send and receive updates
from all his employees, and often needs some images or other documents as well.

Principles:
Make discovering and communicating with nearby users easy and enjoyable. Make
switching between Bluetooth and network seamless and intuitive. Make the
inability to communicate a thing of the past.
