# project-team3-L0101

Inital Plan: 

Our "Scrum Master" was a normal member of the team, except with a few added responsibilities. Firstly and most importantly, our Scrum Master planned meetings, considering the time and location constraints of individuals as well as time left for the project. For example, most of our team members had directly conflicting schedules, so our Scrum Master instead insisted that the group meet once a week electronically via Skype early in the morning for planning meetings. Our Scrum Master also frequently consulted individual team members outside meetings, taking and sharing notes about any important status updates (i.e. completion) as status updates were infrequent. This and the meetings meant that the Scrum Master was a note taker during meetings.These notes would be used during status meetings and updated as needed. Details were added since status meetings were more detailed and included progress and not just milestones. Tasks were sized based entirely on difficulty. A small sized task could be completed in an hour, medium sized task in less than a day and large tasks spanned over  more than one day. During our initial planning meeting, our metrics for an easy task and difficult tasks were based entirely on estimates based on our abilities, as well as what each task encompassed. Our entire team, including the scrum master agreed on the size of the task by consensus, and little argument was raised over the size of the task.

Last sprint, we planed and managed to get our P2P chat working (with some connection issues). So for this sprint, we were trying to implement our original MVP which was the implementation of the group chat feature of our application, while also perfecting the connection for P2P chat. Also, we wanted to enhance the appearance of our UI and make imporvements to what seemed to be a very plain looking UI from the previous phase. After we complete our implementation of the group chat, the original MVP will mostly be fulfilled. However, that leaves us with the remaining user stories (recall phase 1) namely, user stories 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 are on our low priority as of now and we plan to complete those in our final sprint. 

To be specific, we planned to accomplish the following:
1. Stable connection for P2P chat
2. Basic group chat
3. Store chat messages and retrieve later on
4. Store chat messages of a closed chat and retrieve when opened.
5. Revamp UI to make it more visually appealing.
6. Create UI for group chat.

Like the previous sprint, we divided our whole group in half to work on the back-end and the front-end. 

	* Front-end: improving the UI, fixing small bugs with the previous UI, improving appearence 
	- Sneh, Taras, Alex, Siddharth

	* Back-end: implementing the group chat 
	- Akshay, Priyen

At first, we were just planning on keeping our UI simple and adding color to enhance appearance. Later on, we decided that having tabs for "All Conversations", "Groups", and "Open Chats" would be more user friendly instead of having a seperate intent for each. We also decided to add a splash screen to the start screen, which gives it a "Facebook look". 

Review and Retrospective: 

 
The first week of this sprint wasn't very productive as all the group members had plenty of things on their plates. So like the previous sprint, we had to leave the work for the week after. This lack of progress led to a growth of backlog for the second week.

The second week was the week we got a lot of stuff done. The UI was changed, and we implemented the group chat (WE NEED TO ADD MORE).
 
Improvements: 


1. As usual we couldn't get anything done during the first week. We really tried to improve on this from the previous sprint however, we failed badly at it. It would help to ease work load if the first week of the sprint is productive. We would like to really improve on this point. This should be made a major priority for the next and final sprint. 

2. We lacked some organization. Members did work that was the job of another person, and hence some of the members did not have the same amount of commits as other members. At this point, this wasn't a big issue, but we shouldn't have lacked organization considering how deep we are into the project right now. We should improve on communicating with each other.  

3. Meetings. This sprint, we only had a few meetings that involved all the group members. Last sprint, we did a great job of doing Skype meetings however, this did not work for this sprint. We wanted to keep the Skype meetings going however due to the work load our group members had, the meetings were not done as we expected them to be done. This could have been improved if we managed our time well.  

What went well?: 

1. Like the previous sprint, group members were on the look out for each other. We helped each other out a lot whenever we got into tight situations. Some group members were taking initiative to achieve our goals for this sprint. When members were done with their task they tried to help the others with their tasks. This should be repeated in the final sprint and it's a good sign of team work! 

2. Conflicts on GitHub. We were really able to reduce the conflicts this time around. We felt much more comfortable with GitHub for this sprint, and it is because of this reason we weren't caught up with fixing many conflicts.
